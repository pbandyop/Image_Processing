Program for image processing
==============================

This program helps in processing the image file with different filters. 


Software/Hardware details of the program development.

1) The development is done on Linux OS (Fedora 14).
2) The development is done in OpenCV version 2.4.5 with C/C++ API. Initially the program was build with only C API but due to some deprecation of C API in OpenCV, it was later replaced with C++ OpenCV APIs.

For successfully running the program, OpenCV needs to be installed.
